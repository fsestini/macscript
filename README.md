# MacScript: macOS desktop automation library

MacScript is a Haskell library for desktop automation in macOS. It aims to offer
a core set of simple features, including querying and controlling system and UI
elements like windows, displays, keyboard, and mouse, and listening to events
from them.

MacScript is provided as a library, so that you can freely leverage the Haskell
programming language and its entire ecosystem to build your own desktop
automation tool, from a simple script to a full-fledged tiling window manager.

The library is extremely unstable and WIP; please avoid until it hits Hackage.
It is being tested on the following systems:

* macOS High Sierra 10.13.5
* macOS El Capitan 10.11.0
